        <br>
			<p>Jeremy is a visionary, educator, believer, and podcast host who has had a unique journey, but one that many can relate to.
		</p>
			<p>
			Raised in Northwest Chicago, Jeremy learned from his father the importance of the people you surround yourself with, and how they shape who you are. His father would always remind him, “Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are.”
			</p> 
			<p>
			However, Jeremy struggled with fitting in and idolizing others, leading him down a path of drugs, alcohol, toxic relationships, and denial. This led him to an awakening experience that shifted the trajectory of his life, as he had the ears to hear a different message; his life hasn’t been the same since.
			</p>
			<p>
			He began to take his first steps towards a path of self-discovery and healing where he began studying various disciplines such as religion, philosophy, Taoism, and quantum physics. Through his studies, he realized that all these disciplines shared a common belief: 			
			We are powerful beings, and together, we are even more powerful.
			</p>			  
			<p>With this, Jeremy recognized his mission: to open the hearts of others and support the world by helping people recognize healing and transformation are not only possible, but only An ARM’s Reach away…
			</p>			
			<p>Along Jeremy’s transformation journey, he crossed paths with Dean Graziosi, Tony Robbins, and Brittany Mondido. 			  
			While working with Tony & Dean, he became the #1 closer for their company and was an integral piece in taking their coaching business to new heights through conscious sales and connection.
			</p>
			<p>			  
			After working with some of the biggest people in the personal development industry, Jeremy decided to follow his heart and join forces with Brittany at <a href="https://anarmsreach.com/"target ="_blank">An ARM’s Reach Global™</a>, driven by their shared vision for a better world that focuses on the evolution of our people and our planet. </p>			  
			<p>Jeremy’s story is a beacon of hope in a world where many feel lost, separate, and disconnected. He reminds us that no matter how hard we may have fallen, we can always rise again and allow our experiences to be a catalyst to becoming the best version of ourselves. <br>			  
			Join him on this incredible journey, and together, let’s reach for the stars and truly live.</p>
